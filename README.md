# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Create a ReactJS project to develop a 24-hour interactive timeline component with the following
features:
● Time Markers: Display time markers for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00.
● Interactive Events: Allow users to add, move, and delete events on the timeline.
● Event Display: Each event should display a label on mouse hover with the event name
and the start and end times.
● Responsive Design: Ensure the timeline is responsive and adjusts to different screen
sizes.
● Zoom Functionality: Implement zoom functionality to allow users to place events at
exact times as needed.
Requirements:
● State Management: Use React state and context API for managing the state of the
timeline and events.
● Event Handling: Implement event handling for adding, moving, and deleting events.
Steps:
Project Setup:
● Initialize a new ReactJS project using Create React App.
● Install necessary dependencies.
Component Structure:
● Create a Timeline component to display the 24-hour timeline with time markers.
● Create an Event component to display individual events on the timeline.
● Create a ZoomControl component to handle zoom functionality.
State Management:
● Use React's useState and useContext for state management.
● Create a context for managing the list of events and the current zoom level.
Time Markers:
● Display time markers for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00 within the Timeline component.
Implement functions to add, move, and delete events.
● Use mouse events to allow users to drag and drop events to different time slots.
Event Display:
● Show event labels on mouse hover with the event name, start time, and end time.
Responsive Design:
● Use CSS and media queries to ensure the timeline is responsive and adjusts to different
screen sizes.
Zoom Functionality:
● Implement zoom controls to allow users to zoom in and out of the timeline for more
precise event placement.
